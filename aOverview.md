Problem: Image Processing and Analysis

You are given a folder containing a set of images in JPG format. Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following operations:

Read all the images from the folder and create a list of image objects.

Implement a context manager that opens each image file and ensures it is closed properly after processing.

Use the concurrent.futures module to parallelize the image processing tasks across multiple CPU cores.

For each image, perform the following operations concurrently:

Convert the image to grayscale using image processing libraries like PIL or OpenCV.
Apply a noise reduction filter to the grayscale image.
Detect and extract faces from the processed image using a face detection algorithm or library.
Store the processed images and their corresponding face images in separate folders.

Use a database library (e.g., sqlite3 or an ORM like SQLAlchemy) to store metadata about the processed images, such as the image name, original size, processed size, and number of faces detected.

Generate a report summarizing the image processing results, including the total number of images processed, the average number of faces detected per image, and any other relevant statistics.

This problem integrates various advanced Python concepts, including file handling, context managers, concurrent programming, image processing, face detection, database access, and reporting. It challenges you to apply your skills across different domains to solve a complex problem.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this problem according to your specific interests and goals.
